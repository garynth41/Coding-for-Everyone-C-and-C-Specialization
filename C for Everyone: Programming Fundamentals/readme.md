# About this Course
This course is for everyone. In the new world we live in, coding is a universally valuable skill, whether you're a scientist, artist, or a humanist. Algorithms are everywhere, and we all have to understand how they work. The C language is particularly well suited as an introduction to coding: It's a tried-and-true language, and it allows you to understand computing processes at a deep level. 

No prior knowledge of coding is needed for this course. We'll start at the beginning.
The time estimated time commitment for this course is five hours a week for five weeks.
