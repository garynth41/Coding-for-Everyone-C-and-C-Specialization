# C for Everyone: Structured Programming

## About this Course
In the new world we live in, coding is a universally valuable skill, whether you're a scientist, artist, or a humanist. Algorithms are everywhere, and we all have to understand how they work. The C language is particularly well suited as an introduction to coding: It's a tried-and-true language, and it allows you to understand computing processes at a deep level. You will also get an introduction to more advanced programming in C++ in the final module. 

This is a continuation of C for Everyone: Fundamentals, which you should take before beginning this course. 
The time estimated time commitment for this course is five hours a week for five weeks.
