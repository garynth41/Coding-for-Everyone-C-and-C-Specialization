# Coding-for-Everyone-C-and-C-Specialization
Beginner to Programmer — Learn to Code in C &amp; C++. Gain a deep understanding of computer programming by learning to code, debug, and solve complex problems with C and C++.

## WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
* Write and debug code in C and C++ programming languages
* Understand algorithms, and how to properly express them

## SKILLS GAINED
* Algorithms
* C Programming
* coding
* C++
* Computer Programming
* Graph Theory
* C++11
* Graph Algorithms
* Standard Template Library

## About this Specialization
This Specialization is intended for all programming enthusiasts, as well as beginners, computer and other scientists, and artificial intelligence enthusiasts seeking to develop their programming skills in the foundational languages of C and C++. Through the four courses — two in C, and two in C++ — you will cover the basics of programming in C and move on to the more advanced C++ semantics and syntax, which will prepare you to apply these skills to a number of higher-level problems using AI algorithms and Monte Carlo evaluation in complex games.

## Applied Learning Project
This specialization gave me a solid foundation to start coding in C and C++ right from the start. Every module presents ample opportunities for writing programs and finding errors in code and fixing errors. Building on my knowledge, I learned to demonstrate an understanding of coding in a practice-intensive final assessment capstone-like project.
